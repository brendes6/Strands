Strands Solver Project

This project is a C program that is capable of solving the New York Times 'strands' game. This program takes in a file
with a specified grid of letters and the size of word expected, and then gives finds all words possible and allows the user
to solve the grid themselves given the word list.

This project was done as the final project for Clemson's CPSC 1070 class.
